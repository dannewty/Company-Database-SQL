Here i am creating my stored procedure by starting with dbo.sp to indicate that this is a stored procedure, also by calling the proc EmployeeGetAll i am indicating to the user that the results will be from the Employee table.

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.spEmployeeGetAll
AS 
BEGIN 
	SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name
	FROM Employee
END

EXEC dbo.spEmployeeGetAll


Here i will alter the procedure and add a nocount therfore when i execute my procedure it will not give me the amount of rows that have been affected. 

ALTER PROCEDURE dbo.spEmployeeGetAll
AS 
BEGIN 
	SET NOCOUNT ON;
	SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name
	FROM Employee
END



Here i will create a new procedure where i will use a variable to limit the result. 

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.spGetEmployeeByLastName
	@last_name VARCHAR (40)
AS 
BEGIN
	SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name 
	FROM Employee
	WHERE last_name = @Last_name
END

EXEC dbo.spGetEmployeeByLastName Walker


ALTER PROCEDURE dbo.spGetEmployeeByLastName
	@last_name VARCHAR (40),
	@first_name VARCHAR (40)
AS 
BEGIN
	SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name 
	FROM Employee
	WHERE last_name = @Last_name AND first_name = @first_name
END
